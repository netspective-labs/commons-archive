# How to use the library

First you will need a Personal Access Token (PAT), in order to create it, follow these steps.

Go to Github account settings and select "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens".

Click on "Generate new token".

Give your token a name and select the permissions listed:

- repo
- workflow
- packages
- gist
- notifications
- project

Click on "Generate token" and copy the token or save it in a notepad temporarily so you don't lose it.

## Creating an Astro project

Install the `Astro CLI` by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g astro
```

Run the following command to create a new Astro project:

```
pnpm create astro@latest
```

If you don't have `pnpm` installed globally in your computer run this command and the previous one again (you may need to close and open a new terminal after the `pnpm` installation)

```
npm i -g pnpm
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd my-project
```

You will also need to add this to the `astro.config.mjs` file:

```
export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    ssr: {
      noExternal: ['@netspective-labs/nlc-astro'],
    },
  },
});
```

Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your `Astro` project running.

## .npmrc file

Then you will need to create an `.npmrc` file in the root of your `Astro` project:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN_VALUE
@netspective-labs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

```
pnpm install @netspective-labs/nlc-universal
```

```

## Deploying package

We use `Github Actions` as our CI/CD tool, you can check `.github/workflows/main.yml` for more info there. Github will automatically deploy a new version of the package as soon as someone pushes a commit with a _new version_ in the `package.json`.

We recommend you to read this [semantic-versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning)
docs if you are not aware already of it.

To update the version, you can run the following commands, depending on whether the update is _major_, _minor_, or _patch_.

```
npm run upgrade-major
```

```
npm run upgrade-minor
```

```
npm run upgrade-patch
```

Once you upgraded the package version, you can now push:

```
git push
```

This will push your latest changes to the Github repository and trigger the Github action that deploys the package.
You can check this in the _Actions_ tab in the Github repository.
